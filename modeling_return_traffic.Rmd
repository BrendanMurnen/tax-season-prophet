Load in scraped data from other sheet
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

submissions_by_week <- read_csv('IRS_indv_returns_by_week.csv')
submissions_by_week
```

plot to see the pattern
```{r}
sub_clean <- submissions_by_week %>% mutate(week_ending = lubridate::yday(week_ending))

subs_by_year <- 
  ggplot(sub_clean, aes(x=as.Date(week_ending, origin = '2020-01-01'), y=this_year, group=year,color=year)) + 
    geom_point()

subs_by_year
```

Predictive models
```{r}
library(prophet)

df <- submissions_by_week %>% select(ds = 'week_ending', y = 'this_year')
model <- prophet(df)

future <- make_future_dataframe(model, periods = 52)

forecast <- predict(model, future)
prophet_plot_components(model, forecast)
```
